# ðŸŒ³ Binary Tree Operations in Java

This repository contains **every basic operation on a Binary Tree**, including:  
- Inorder Traversal  
- Preorder Traversal  
- Postorder Traversal  
- Add Node  
- Delete Node  

It also includes a Java solution for the [LeetCode Problem: Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/).
